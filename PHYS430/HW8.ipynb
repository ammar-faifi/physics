Using linear interpolation between these two values, it was determined that each degree increase in temperature raises the enthalpy by 29.2 J. Since the enthalpy at 300 K is greater than our enthalpy by 543 J, the temperature needs to decrease by 19 K \n",

As a result, the temperature needs to decrease by 46 K, which is calculated by dividing 1358 by 29.4. Consequently, the concluding temperature is 154 K."
